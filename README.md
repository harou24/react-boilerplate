This is a minimal react boilerplate that includes the following dependencies:
- React
- React-dom
- Webpack (webpack-cli, webpack-dev-server, html-webpack-plugin)
- Babel-loader (@babel/core, @babel/preset-env, @babel/preset-react)

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the root of the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Your app will be running at `http://localhost:8080/`.
6. You can now start building your React application.
